# QA-001 — Add deterministic test, lint, coverage, and audit gates
Status: open
Priority: P1
Blocked by: DEP-001
Tracker status at migration: `PARTIAL`

- Owner: —
- Dependencies: `ARCH-001`, critical security tests
- Primary files:
  - `package.json`
  - `vitest.config.ts`
  - `playwright.config.ts`
  - New: `eslint.config.js`
  - New: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  - Existing tests under `tests/`

#### Current state

- Unit suite parse failure is fixed.
- Live SIGAA tests are opt-in.
- `package.json` still has no default `test`, lint, coverage, audit, or quality
  script.
- Release workflow publishes after only install/build.

#### Required scripts

- `test`
- `test:unit`
- `test:integration`
- `test:live`
- `typecheck`
- `lint`
- `coverage`
- `audit:prod`
- `quality`

#### Acceptance criteria

- Pull requests run deterministic checks without SIGAA credentials.
- Live canary is separate and opt-in/scheduled.
- Coverage thresholds protect sanitizer, IPC validation, account storage,
  coordinator, and download path modules.
- Publishing cannot start unless quality checks pass.
- Lint prevents new unrestricted `any` usage in shared/security code.

#### Verification

```text
npm ci
npm run quality
npm run test:e2e
```
